If the pattern does not contain a slash /, git treats it as a shell
       glob pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative
       to the location of the .gitignore file (relative to the toplevel of
       the work tree if not from a .gitignore file).

  Â·   Otherwise, git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for
       consumption by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in
       the pattern will not match a / in the pathname. For example,
       "Documentation/*.html" matches "Documentation/git.html" but not
       "Documentation/ppc/ppc.html" or
       "tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html".
